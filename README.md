# Cathode Rush
Cathode Rush is a game I worked on for a game jam in June/July of 2021.

After completing [this version](https://kyotaexe.itch.io/cathode-rush) for the jam, I decided to work on it more.

Sadly, the artist I was working with had to move on, and so did I, so this is (at least for now) an abandoned project.
